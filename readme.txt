The Official LayUp payment gateway plugin for woocommerce.


== Description ==

LayUp is a layby payment solution. LayUp Schedules payments and ensure that your clients
pay securely, effectively and on time. In Short, LayUp takes the parameters set out by you, and
schedules a payment plan for your clients. Once a payment plan has been completed we notify
you.

There are 3 stories that are of importance to a merchant.

1. Order Creation
1. Deposit Received (and holding Stock for your client)
1. Order Completion.

LayUp allows you to take full control over the entire payment process if you wish to do so. We
also provide a convenient front-end for users to use. The front-end should significantly reduce
the time to integrate and get you started using LayUp as soon as possible.
Once a order is completed and we notify you the responsibility lies on your end to release stock
and lease with your client about delivery ect.
